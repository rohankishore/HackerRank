## There are a total of 36 outcomes (6 * 6).

### Out of 36, the following outcomes are greater than 9 (since that'll be easier than counting entries which are less than 9). So we don't count them:

## `{4, 6}, {5, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 4}, {6, 5}, {6, 6}`

So we are left with 36 - 6 = 30. (outcomes having sum AT MOST 9)

# The answer is 30/36 = `5/6`.
