# Day2: More Dice

### Task
In a single toss of *2* fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of .

## Solution

### Total Outcomes = 6 x 6 = 36
### Favorable Outcomes = {(1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1)} 
> No (3,3) since the digits should NOT be similar.

### So the answer will be 4/36 =  `1/9`.
